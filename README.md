## Challenges Faced and How Was it Overcome

 1. We have faced some challenge in implementing of main file. But by reffering multiple platform we solved the issue.
 2. We have issues in pytest and performing actions, but putting continous effort we resolved pytest.
 3. Put muliple attempt for improvment code quality.
